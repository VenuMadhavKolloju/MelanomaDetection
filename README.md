# Melanoma Detection
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Technologies Used
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- os
- PIL
- tensorflow
- augmentor
- pathlib
- google colab

<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->


## Conclusions
Below skin disease have high predicatablity compared with rest of the skin diseases. actinic keratosis, dermatofibroma, nevus, pigmented benign keratosis, squamous cell carcinoma and vascular lesion.

The augumentation statergy helped in getting rid of overfitting.

Rectifying the imbalance applying Augmentor helped in getting rid of biased learning and better generalization.
